### About Me

Hey! Iâ€™m Arunit â€” a curious soul on a mission to **craft the web with purpose and polish**.  
I chose the username **LightCreator1007** as a kid (i bet most of did this stuff) , and honestly? Itâ€™s grown on me.It's like that onse shirt you wont throw away XD.

- BTech student @ **Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur**
- Learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** â€” the fun stuff that makes browsers dance
- Currently exploring **how to bring ideas to life on the web**, one pixel at a time
- Always up for a good tech challenge.

###Tech Stack (So Far)

- Frontend: HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript (Vanilla) (ongoing)
- Next Up: React | Node.js | MongoDB | Express

*Iâ€™ll keep this section updated as I grow â€” version control, even for myself!*

### 2025 Goals

- Build and launch my **first full-stack app**
- Learn the full MERN stack
- Contribute to open source (even the scary ones)
- Land an internship / dev role where I can **actually ship code**

### ðŸ’¬ Fun Facts

- My headâ€™s a jungle of ideas â€” I just need time and caffeine to build them.
- I am an Anime fanatic, looking forward to build something related to it!
